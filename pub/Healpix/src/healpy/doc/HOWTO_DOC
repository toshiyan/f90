The documentation uses Sphinx, some rst files and the doc included in the source code.

To create documentation :

- compile healpy and install it so that it is accessible from python
- go to the doc/ directory
- [OPTIONAL]
  $ export SPHINXBUILD=/usr/bin/sphinx-build 
  $ # or wherever sphinx-build is installed
- $ make html

This will create the documentation in doc/.build/html.

The documentation of the master branch is also available at readthedoc :

    http://healpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

It is rebuild from the master branch at each commit (so it is always the latest version).

The documentation is also on github, using gh pages (I followed the tutorial there : 
http://lucasbardella.com/report/hosting-your-sphinx-docs-in-github/).

All the documentation is thus accessible in :
http://healpy.github.com/healpy/

It is contained in a special branch of the project called gh-pages.

To modify this documentation, create a special directory :

mkdir healpydoc
cd healpydoc
git clone git@github.com:healpy/healpy.git html
cd html
git checkout gh-pages

Then, go to your healpy directory:

cd .../healpy
cd doc/
BUILDDIR=/path/to/healpydoc/ make html

It will override the files in healpydoc/html, which you can then check and commit. Since the building of the documentation is manual, it is not necessarily up-to-date. Prefer the readthedocs method.
